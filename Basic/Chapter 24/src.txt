Objective: Recently, arm facilitation has been interested in gait rehabilitation. However, there have been
few studies concerning arm facilitation in patients with Parkinson¡¯s disease (PD). The aim of our study
was to investigate the effect of increasing arm weights on gait pattern in patients with PD.
Methods: Twenty-seven patients with PD were enrolled, and they underwent gait analysis using a
three-dimensional motion capture system. Sandbags were applied to the distal forearms in all partici-
pants. We compared gait parameters including arm swing, pelvic motion, spatiotemporal data, and rel-
ative rotational angle between the weighted and unweighted gaits.
Results: The total arm-swing amplitude and pelvic rotation were significantly higher when walking with
additional arm weights than without arm weights. Cadence, walking speed, stride length, and swing
phase were significantly higher, whereas stride time, double-support time, and stance phase were signif-
icantly lower, when walking with additional arm weights than without arm weights.
Conclusions: We conclude that adding weights to the arm during walking may facilitate arm and pelvic
movements, which results in changes to gait patterns. The therapeutic use of additional arm weights
could be considered for gait rehabilitation in PD to improve gait impairment.
Significance: Arm-swing facilitation using weight load improved gait in Parkinson¡¯s disease.
